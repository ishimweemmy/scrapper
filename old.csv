Wrong Python In The Drive,"In fact, it doesn’t sound out of the ordinary at all. In the end, it’s a programming language, after all. There are worse things you can find in someone’s luggage than an up-close and personal experience with a live Ball Python snake. To begin with, we don’t believe they are appropriate flying arrangements for a Royal………. On the other hand, it may have resulted in mass hysteria on board the plane.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-36.png,The snake and the passengers had a pleasant experience on the plane.
Meth-Burrito,"This wasn’t your average dinner. This reworked burrito’s filling contains a bag of meth, so you know it was cooked. Because of this, the TSA is required to contact local law enforcement if it discovers illegal substances during screening.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-35.png,"As the traveler was detained by the local police, it was obvious that someone was going to starve."
You Can’t Get Away With This.,"People that think this is a serious matter, such as you and me, take the time to check their pockets for metal objects like phones, nail clippers, and keys, and they even sip the water they just bought.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-34.png,"A surprising number of people attempt to evade the scanner by using fakes or artistic embellishments. The TSA is not amused by these jokes, and we can assure you of that. Make sure your pockets are clean before you leave the house."
Human Skull,"How did you manage to get yourself into this predicament? In order to get through security faster, don’t bring a human skull in your carry-on luggage.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-33.png,"As a terrible side effect, the TSA uncovered human remains in the clay pots purchased by the passenger, which were only discovered when the TSA examined them. On the day of the incident, there was a crime scene!"
X-ray Pizza,"There is nothing wrong with feeling a little hungry before boarding. The X-ray machine is ready to scan this pizza. We’re going to assume that the airport’s pizza joints aren’t up to snuff for this particular tour. You’re bringing a pizza from the city for some reason, aren’t you? What’s the deal with the crust?",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-32.png,Maybe it’s because of the variety of toppings they provide? Remember that sharing is caring in any situation.
Neon-Colored Bow and Arrows,"Hawkeye or Katniss Everdeen, who do you prefer? There was no hope for this particular tourist, no matter how hard they tried Attempting to board a plane with a neon-colored bow and arrow kit in your carry-on luggage was a bad decision, especially when the equipment was visible.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-31.png,"Pack your sharpies in your checked luggage, as you cannot bring weapons in your carry-on bag, if you plan on traveling with them."
"In Bear Vadar, there are concealed knives.","When TSA investigators discovered two hidden blades in none other than a Darth Vader teddy bear, they knew they were dealing with a powerful force. Apparently, a lone wanderer descended into the abyss. A young Jedi padawan in a galaxy far, far away will have new hope of bringing down the terrible empire one day.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-18.jpeg,Your Imperial credits will be taken as a fee if you try to stow weapons in your carry-on luggage.
Airport body scans reveal all scandal,"Many people have expressed privacy concerns about the new airport security scanners, which have gained popularity as an alternative to invasive body searches. TSA scanners made many travelers feel “too exposed” when they saw their scans on the agents’ screens when they passed through.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-30.png,"Even several TSA employees spoke up about how uncomfortable it was for them to go through airport security at times. Many people had strong feelings about it when it was first floated in early 2010, but the developing sense of unease over national security led them to abandon it."
Ceremonial Scissors,"Carry-on bags can have scissors up to 4 inches from the fulcrum, but don’t bring your official ribbon-cutting scissors along. Simply look at these scissors — they’re enormous! Please don’t be abrasive with the TSA officers.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-29.png,"No matter how big your scissors are, you will still have to wait in the screening line, so don’t even think about it."
Baby Shark,"This tiny shark (doo doo doo doo doo doo…) was discovered in a passenger’s carry-on luggage and really shocked us. It’s not going to help if you tell a bunch of lies when someone asks about this. We can all agree that taking something like this on a plane is, well, fishy.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-28.png,Find out if there are any restrictions on carrying biological samples that you should be aware of before boarding your journey.
The Hand of Freddy Krueger,"Thanks to TSA agents, Elm Street will once again be a safe place to sleep. The discovery of this glove in a traveler’s carry-on bag saved the lives of other passengers from horror. TSA agents see sharp weapons and equipment being removed from checked luggage all the time since it is such a classic.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-27.png,"There must be a reason this person decided to carry the most obvious no-no item into an airplane, no matter how fake it was. That isn’t rocket science, guy. It makes perfect sense! We can presume that some flights were unable to take off that day."
Moose Droppings,In the Moose’s Mouth,https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-26.png,"As long as you don’t bring home a bag of animal feces in your carry-on, souvenirs from your trip are a terrific idea. A passenger’s bag of organic matter turned out to be a bag of moose droppings they brought back from their Alaskan vacation."
Live Smoke Grenade,Nobody can explain why someone would inspect a military smoke canister with a live military smoke canister in it.,https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-25.png,"Before a flight, leave your grenades at home. To make matters worse, passengers who bring items that could be mistaken for real explosives will have the terminal evacuated and will find that their pockets are burning with fines."
Lipstick Knife,"This item is perfect for women who want to appear their best. Instead of lipstick, this lipstick tube included a knife. Maybe “Bloody Red” would be a better name for this colour? In her carry-on bag, she tried to smuggle it through the security checkpoints.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-24.png,"Packing sharp things should only be done in your checked luggage, not your carry-on, as a safety precaution."
Plastic Bag Full of Eels,"Smuggling anything aboard a plane is a bad idea, no matter what your intentions are. In addition to the 163 tropical fish and 22 invertebrates in the bag, there was a slew of eels. The TSA authorities confiscated the eels and the rest of the animals when a flyer tried to carry them past security in checked luggage.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-23.png,All of the animals were handed up to the US Fish and Wildlife Service by the passenger on the flight.
Bullet-Shaped Whiskey Stones,"To bring your bullet-shaped whiskey stones in your carry-on bag while flying is just not cool. We do appreciate a cold single malt whiskey. For this reason, it is not permitted to be transported in carry-on luggage, even if the projectile is removed.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-22.png,This also applies to necklaces and bracelets adorned with bullet shales that don’t contain any gunpowder or powder but are instead entire projectiles.
Double Fault,"“Why to drink and to drive when you can smoke and fly,” famously quipped Bob Marley. We can only assume that this traveler was already intoxicated when he packed his marijuana close to a knife for TSA screening.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-21.png,"Before flying, even if you have a medical marijuana license card, you must have your medical marijuana and cannabis-infused products tested by law police to ensure they are safe."
A Live Cat in Checked Luggage,"It’s possible to bring your pet along on a trip and get it to your destination safely. This poor feline was practically snatched out of the bag. Slim, a 6-month-old cat, was discovered in a checked suitcase by airport security officials.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-20.png,"As a result, the cat was taken in by the Humane Society of Northwestern Pennsylvania while its owners were charged with animal abuse."
An Inert Mortar Round,"So how could we alert other travelers about the possibility of “incoming” or “fire in the hole” TSA authorities discovered this inert mortar round in a traveler’s checked bag? Such instances lead to costly evacuations, delays, and delayed flights as explosives experts decide if the object is inert or a genuine live explosion.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-19.png,"Think twice before packing these items, as they will be a pain for you and your fellow travelers."
A Phony IED,"One of the passengers on this flight was going to explosives detecting training exercise. Since it was an inert IED, he should have known better than to walk through a TSA screening with it. Six lanes were instantly closed as a result of the fake IED, resulting in hundreds of additional travelers being inconvenienced.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-18.png,"While the tourist who carried the item was detained, the agents already had their training, which was a blessing in disguise."
An 8.5” Knife Inside an Enchilada,"This passenger’s motives were not evil, but they were delicious. In the enchilada she had brought for the flight, the TSA inspectors discovered an 8.5″ knife that had been left behind. In order to go to where she needed to go, we gave the passenger permission to board the plane.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-17.png,"Don’t forget to check your luggage before the security checkpoint, and if you’re taking a knife on board, put it in your checked bag."
A Fake Bomb,"Do you believe the traveller thought it would be a good idea to check this item in? But even though it may appear real, a TSA bomb specialist or police department bomb squad must be called to handle such a situation.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-16.png,"When real or fake explosives are used, the results can be disastrous. This can lead to costly evacuations, delays, and canceled flights, as well as high penalties for those caught with them."
Firecrackers,"Really? Again? After detecting explosives in a traveler’s carry-on bag, the TSA agent undoubtedly thought this way as well. Any type of explosive, whether it’s in a carry-on or a checked luggage, is strictly prohibited on aircraft.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-15.png,"Right on the package of the firecrackers, there is a “Warning: explosive” warning. The word “killer” on the front of the book doesn’t help, either. In the event that you intend to use them, it is best to purchase them at your final destination."
3D Printed Gun,"3D printers are now more widely available and more affordable than ever before. These things may be difficult to locate because they are invisible to x-rays and metal detectors, yet they are capable of firing multiple rounds.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-17.jpeg,"When a traveler elected to leave his revolver behind and board his aircraft, the TSA confiscated a 3D-printed gun filled with live bullets. Fortunately, the airport’s operations were not adversely affected by the incident."
Bottle of Seahorses,"Once again, we’re dealing with a situation that’s worse than it appears on the surface. TSA agents discovered an illegal large liquor bottle in the passenger’s carry-on when she arrived at the screening station. Second, the bottle contained five decomposing seahorses, a species that is now critically endangered. As a result, the bottle was taken away.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-14.png,"Even still, seeing the critically endangered aquatic animals in such a miserable state broke our hearts. Don’t support a business that exploits animals of any type."
A Cannon Barrel,"No, I’m not surprised by the discovery of this armament in a checked bag. You are looking at an actual cannon barrel in this picture. Cannonballs have been discovered by TSA personnel in the past, but this is the first time a barrel has been discovered.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-13.png,"A cannon aboard a plane? What kind of person does that? Aside from that, we’d like to know how much that one piece of luggage costs to screen for overweight."
Ninja Climbing Claws,"Did the traveller bring this as a carry-on because they were worried about being overbooked? “Even if I have to climb and attach myself to the plane’s ceiling, I’m taking that flight. Don’t you dare try to stop me from leaving today.” Well, that’s a good question. The passenger’s boarding attempt was thwarted.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-12.png,"In the event that we tell you to pack it in your checked luggage, don’t be startled."
Gun Belt Buckle,"Just to begin with, this belt buckle is a fashion misstep, you know what I mean? What was going through your head when you decided to bring a firearm replica to the airport? Replicas of firearms are also outlawed since they can frighten people. As a result of your ill-advised wardrobe choice, you’ve been arrested.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-11.png,"While it’s important to wear loose, comfortable clothing when flying, we ask that you do so with discretion."
Batarangs,"All flights to Gotham City have been postponed because we believe we’ve discovered Batman. Well, his name wasn’t Bruce Wayne, but we guess he was moved by the phrase “A hero can be anyone” and thought, “A hero can be anyone.”",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-10.png,"These Batrangs were discovered in the carry-on luggage of a traveler. Apparently, other travelers were merely enraged by the situation, and not frightened at all. If you’re flying with anything sharp, please place it in your checked luggage."
Swiss Army-Style iPhone Case,"While this iPhone case may be useful on a daily basis, using it on a trip could be problematic. Airplane cabins are prohibited from allowing knives to be brought on board for safety reasons. Keep all pointed objects in your checked baggage.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-9.png,"On your next flight, consider bringing a case that’s a little more “friendly” to your iPhone. The only thing metallic about it should be the case color."
No-Such-Thing Grenade,"We have little doubt that the discovery of this novelty grenade in a passenger’s carry-on bag sparked more than a few complaints. Despite the fact that they are clearly a joke, these items are nevertheless treated as explosives unless proven otherwise by professionals. It should go without saying that neither live nor inert explosives are permitted on flights.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-8.png,Not even in a checked suitcase. Delays and expensive evacuations are common consequences of bringing prohibited items on board.
Antique Flare Gun with Cannonball,This passenger’s carry-on bag may have contained pirate-themed stuff if he or she was preparing a pirate-themed party. Was there any attempt made by the passenger to conceal the cannonball? Think about how much that carry-on bag weighs as well.,https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-7.png,"There are no exceptions to this rule, therefore travelers are urged to leave any real or fake explosives at home."
Secret Weapon,"Maybe that was done in kindergarten because that looks so amateurish. We can clearly see a computer loaded with modeling clay and duct tape if we look again. But wait, there’s a loaded 9mm pistol buried behind all the clay and duct tape.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-6.png,"Despite all the effort put in, the pistol was discovered in a piece of checked luggage, negating the entire purpose of the concealment plan."
Snakes⸺ Not Allowed,Smuggling should never be done. Seven tiny snakes and three small turtles were attempted to be smuggled by this passenger. Please guess where they were concealed if you dare. Passenger pants are a good place to start. Just thinking about how uncomfortable it must have been for them to crawl in there.,https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-16.jpeg,Passenger’s arrest led to the reptiles being taken into custody by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
Flogger,"It’s a complete mystery… This flogger has five blades, which some may find amusing (hey, who am I to judge?). We’d like to know more about that product… What are you doing with a flogger like that?",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-5.png,"Please include this flogger in your checked luggage if you want to use it during your trip, as it is not permitted in a carry-on suitcase."
Hand Grenade for Trailer Hitch,"Okay, so it’s really impressive as a trailer hitch, but taking it on a plane is less tempting to your fellow passengers and TSA officers. For both carry-on and checked luggage, any item that resembles explosives – whether genuine or inert – is prohibited.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-4.png,"In addition, explosives experts must inspect these goods, which slows down the production line and may possibly necessitate the evacuation of the facility."
Armor That Doesn’t Make a Bang,"We’ll be honest, it made us feel a little uneasy. X-ray workers were terrified when they discovered this device in a checked suitcase. They called the police immediately. It’s impossible to dispute that it seems real, and it is. It contained merely electric matches, potassium chlorate, and titanium powder that were not dangerous.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-3.png,This terrifying suicide vest is worn by an explosives trainer who is on the road with his tools of instruction.
Hand Grenades with a Wedding-Theme,"To put it another way, “until death do us part” has a whole new meaning now, doesn’t it? According to the groom, these well-dressed inactive grenades were gifts for his groomsmen. As a result, every time a TSA agent detects a potential explosive, they are required to request assistance from a bomb squad or an appropriate law enforcement agency.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-15.jpeg,"Evacuations, delays, and delayed flights can be caused by the possession of these things."
The Lipstick Stun Gun,"Honestly, you look like a million bucks! This seemingly benign object is actually a stun gun. It’s even embellished to look like a fashionable addition. It is illegal to carry a stun gun in your carry-on bag or on your person while flying.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-2.png,"If you’re traveling with a stun gun, make sure to keep it in your checked luggage exclusively; otherwise, you could get into some difficulty."
10k Cash in a Slow Cooker,"What are we supposed to do about this? In the first place, why would anyone travel with a slow cooker? Why would you hide ten thousand dollars beneath the lid? Everything about this seemed fishy from the get-go! The traveler was able to fly with the slow cooker and the money after all.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-1.png,"Trying to hide something, on the other hand, will cause travel delays, as we can assure you."
Socked and Taped Birds,Greetings and welcome to “101: Raising Suspicion”. TSA inspectors became suspicious about a female passenger because she was dressed in heavy gear. Two birds were found taped to the woman’s leg and chest after a pat-down search.,https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image.png,"The traveler was detained on suspicion of attempting to smuggle and export an endangered species. Now, we’re inclined to use the term “jailbird” to describe that travel companion."
Failed to establish a connection,"During an effort to smuggle 94 iPhones into China while strapped to his body, a Hong Kong citizen was detained at the border. Customs agents became suspicious of the individual because he was behaving oddly. His torso and legs were found strapped with the appropriate electrical devices. Even though it is against the law, people often try to smuggle devices into China from abroad.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-14.jpeg,Smuggling gadgets into the mainland in order to avoid tax and sell them at a profit is becoming increasingly common. He had to wait for all those iPhones to connect before he could make a call…
Grenade Filled With Marijuana,"In order to smuggle drugs, it is not a good idea to conceal them in an imitation grenade. When a passenger in Denver tried to smuggle marijuana into the country in a phoney bomb, authorities discovered the scheme and arrested the individual. At a pre-screening checkpoint, an individual with fake grenades was discovered.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-13.jpeg,"TSA authorities discovered that the objects were stuffed with marijuana after inspecting them as an explosive. There is a good chance that the TSA will detect narcotics in a grenade, even if they aren’t looking for them."
Corpse Prop,"A few people are obsessed with movie memorabilia, and they’ll do anything to get their hands on it, even if it means going across country in a plane. The person sitting next to you on the plane was undoubtedly horrified. A human corpse from the film “Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2” is included in this prop.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-12.jpeg,"It was so lifelike that it resembled a decaying corpse in every way. So, what would you choose to do? What’s worse, sitting next to a gruesome body or a wailing baby?"
Chillin’ out,"There are a lot of lobsters to be found in Boston. But flying a 20-pound live lobster out of Logan International Airport in your suitcase seems a little out of place – at least for the lobster. As far as the TSA agent is concerned, this lobster was the largest he’s ever seen. The TSA does not forbid the transportation of live lobsters; nevertheless, a “clear, plastic, spill-proof container” is required for the transportation of a live lobster.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-11.jpeg,There were no claws being thrown by the lobster during the screening process.
There’s Someone Peering into Your Eyes,"This is something you don’t see every day, even in airports – pawn included. In 2007, airport security at London’s Stansted Airport discovered ten human eyeballs floating in a glass jar. If you thought it was odd up to this point, just wait until you find out what the passenger meant by what they said.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-10.jpeg,"It was purely for his personal use. There you go: it was not intended for scientific or medical research, but rather for consumption… Are we the only ones who find it difficult to sit still in our chairs?"
Chastity belt,Passing through metal detectors while dressed in medieval-era underwear may not be the best mode of transportation for those who are flying. Security at Athens airport stopped a British woman as she passed through a metal detector.,https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-9.jpeg,"In fact, she was wearing her husband’s chastity belt while on vacation to ensure that he would be faithful. These two, in our opinion, urgently require marriage counseling."
$1.2 million in gold bars,"Gold smuggling attempts are sometimes disguised as frequent flyer upgrades because India is the world’s largest purchaser of precious metal. Even if you go through security, it would be a waste to leave your $1,250,000 in gold bars on the plane.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-8.jpeg,"A Boeing 737 flying from Mumbai to Bangkok had 24 gold bars concealed in two bags left in the bathroom compartment, as discovered by the aircraft’s maintenance personnel. An inquiry had been initiated, but no arrests had been made."
"At all times, keep your arms and legs tucked away in your suitcase.","Immigration to other nations is a viable option for many people. There is no justification for putting your children in danger by trying to smuggle them out of the country in a bag. As far as we know, Abou, a child from the Ivory Coast, was found in the luggage of an 18-year-old girl.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-7.jpeg,"The woman was hired by the boy’s father to carry the suitcase, and she was not related to him. It was discovered that the youngster was in a “bad state” when authorities first began investigating the issue. Only by chance did Abou survive."
200 tarantulas,"A person’s beloved pet is undeniably an intimate matter. Even so, an Amsterdam airport officer raised their suspicions when he discovered spiders in a German couple’s luggage during a normal search. On their way back from Peru, the German couple had to wait for a connecting aircraft.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-6.jpeg,Tarantulas and other creepy crawlies that the couple had stored in small boxes began to emerge as soon as they opened the case. Captured and quarantined animals were found to be disease-free.
A Real Tiger cub,"While it’s sweet to bring a stuffed animal as a gift, trying to transport an unattended 2-month-old tiger cub is not. At the Bangkok airport, a woman’s luggage had a sedated tiger cub hidden amid soft toys.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-5.jpeg,"Airport workers saw an image resembling a live animal during X-ray screening, and suspicions were aroused. That wildlife smuggling is simple to get away with and that people don’t fear criticism should change if people are trying to sneak live tigers into airports in their carry-on luggage."
A Pound of Cocaine Under a Toupee,"Toupees are an odd fashion accessory, to begin with, but when you’re trying to bury a pound of cocaine worth 30,000 euros under one, you know it won’t look well. On a trip from Bogota to Barcelona, Spain, a 65-year-old Colombian man was immediately suspicious because of the strange headgear he was wearing, as well as his uneasy demeanor.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-4.jpeg,There are two photos here that indicate why the man attracted the attention of the police.
Aren’t you enthused?,"Movie props are sought-after memorabilia among fans. The “Gladiator” helmet of Maximus Decimus Meridius (Russel Crow) is represented by this exact reproduction. The spikes on this helmet made it ineligible for carry-on luggage, despite the fact that helmets are authorized in checked and carry-on luggage because they are not weapons..",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-3.jpeg,"Fortunately, no other passengers were terrified that Roman legions would invade the plane or that they would be forced to fight wild animals for the amusement of the rest of the flight."
Bees as a present,"When grandparents come to visit, grandkids look forward to receiving gifts from their grandparents. Rather than toys, clothes, or other delights, this grandmother decided to give her grandchildren a jar of bees as a gift. To find out if she could board the plane transporting those harried workers despite the TSA’s lack of a policy on flying insects, the passenger had to get in touch with her airline.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-2.jpeg,EpiPens should have been on hand for everyone who was allergic to bees at the airport.
"Trinity, Redefined?","If you’re nervous about flying, you might find solace in a simple prayer to God. Then again, it’s likely that other passengers will find it awkward to be around someone who carries a cross with a hidden knife.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-1.jpeg,"Checked luggage is the only place for sharp goods like knives and scissors. If the traveler was punished for having forbidden items in their carry-on, we hope they had a safe flight. Amen!"
Firearm Bong,"We want to know how far you can soar. It all depends on how stoned you were when you tried to figure out if your firearm-shaped glass bong could be boarded on an aircraft as a carry-on bag.. TSA does not search for drugs, but if they are found, the local law enforcement is responsible for removing them from the plane.",https://myhealthgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image.jpeg,"TSA agents, on the other hand, see a weapon facsimile as a red flag when it shows up during screening. Real and inert explosives should be left at home while packing checked luggage."
